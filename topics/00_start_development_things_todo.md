# How to start development python
- recommended development tool: VisualStudioCode (VSC)

## first steps
1. download a python kernel-version
- !!! if the installation ask u for a development path - accept the autosetup otherwise you need to setup your environment variables by yourself
- link: https://www.python.org/

2. download VSC or Pycharm or Anaconda or what ever u want to use as DEV-tool in your prefered version
- link: https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. test your instance
- open a terminal (win: cmd, linux/mac: terminal)
- type-in: python --> and press enter
- if you see your installed python version and a new shell will open inside your terminal everything is fine
- the new shell is not a new window or tab, its inside your opened window like: ">>>"
- if an error apear u need to check your environment variables 
- you can close the shell with typing-in: exit() 

4. create a development folder on your explorer to start programming in your python language

5. in VSC
- if you create a .py or .ipynb file sometimes you need to manually install extensions
- allow VSC to install pycharm and all necessary extensions to perfectly run your codingsetup :) 


## python files
- python files/scripts will have the post-ending *.py
- inside python files you are able to program your instructions
- for rapid prototyping method we are using jupyter-notebook extension
- to install jupyter u need to download the jupyter module
- command: pip install jupyter
- post-ending of jupyter-files is *.ipynb
- jupyter notebook files are interactive python notebooks with cells, each cell will handle like a complete own py-script
